# üöå Real-Time Bus Tracking System  

A full-stack web application that enables **real-time tracking of buses**, providing live location updates, route monitoring, and user-friendly management features. Designed with scalability, performance, and reliability in mind, the system ensures seamless communication between backend services and the frontend UI.  

---

## üöÄ Features  

### üë• User Features  
- View buses in real-time on an interactive map.  
- Get live updates on bus location, route, and status.  
- Responsive and mobile-friendly interface.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Features  
- Add, update, and manage buses and routes.  
- Manage users and assign roles (admin, operator, passenger).  
- Monitor bus availability and operational status.  

### ‚ö° Technical Features  
- Real-time location streaming with **Redis in-memory caching** for ultra-fast updates.  
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure user and admin access.  
- **RESTful APIs** for bus data, routes, and live location.  
- Modular and scalable architecture for handling high traffic.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack  

### **Frontend**  
- React.js (with Hooks & Context API/Redux if used)  
- TailwindCSS / CSS for styling  
- Interactive Maps (e.g., Leaflet.js or Google Maps API)  

### **Backend**  
- Node.js & Express.js  
- Redis (for caching real-time location data)  
- MongoDB / SQL (for persistent storage of buses, routes, and users)  

### **Authentication & Security**  
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication  
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)

## üîß Architecture Overview

    A[Bus GPS Device] -->|Sends Location Data| B[Backend API - Node.js/Express]

```

- Location data is ingested by the backend.  
- Redis caches live bus data for fast retrieval.  
- Persistent information (buses, routes, users) is stored in the database.  
- Frontend fetches live data via APIs and updates maps in real time.
